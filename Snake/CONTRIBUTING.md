- All ElementInfo need to be stored and draw at the same time. This is buggy: void DrawItem(ElementInfo? elementInfo) in ConsoleDrawer

- Can move backwards (can go inside itself)
- Do not allow the snake to eat itself (cross itself) or go out of bounds (maybe draw bounds also)

- Offer to play a new game
- Create game menu

- Do not let the snake leave the area
- Eat food with the snake (snake grows)
- Create a win condition and a pointing system
- Try to find better characters to represent snake body parts and food
- Create a graphical and/or a web interface for the game
