- All ElementInfo need to be stored and draw at the same time. This is buggy: void DrawItem(ElementInfo? elementInfo) in ConsoleDrawer

- Can move backwards (can go inside itself)
- Do not allow the snake to eat itself (cross itself) or go out of bounds (maybe draw bounds also)

- Offer to play a new game
- Make game menu fancier

- Create a win condition and a pointing system
- Create a graphical and/or a web interface for the game
- Switch between levels depending on your points
- Add leaderboard
